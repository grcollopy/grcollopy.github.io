      <p><em>Thursday 28th January 2021</em> Due to COVID-19 the services are restricted in the number of people allowed. The plan is to live stream the services so everyone who wants to attend will be able to do so virtually. We will also hold a celebration of Lyns life later in the year when COVID-19 restrictions are relaxed.</p>
